      Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that
      they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
      you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because
      they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
    </p>
      <p class="calibre1">'No,' she said sharply. 'Why?'</p>
      <p class="calibre1">
        'Funny stuff on the news,' Mr Dursley mumbled. 'Owls... shooting
        stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre1">
        ' <i class="calibre5">So</i>?' snapped Mrs Dursley.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre1">
        'Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... youknow
        ... <i class="calibre5">her lot</i> .'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre1">
        Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered
        whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Potter.' He decided he
        didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, 'Theirson – he'd
        be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre1">'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.</p>
      <p class="calibre1">'What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?'</p>
      <p class="calibre1">'Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.'</p>
      <p class="calibre1">
        'Oh, yes,' said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. 'Yes, I quite
        agree.'
      </p>
      <p class="calibre1">How very wrong he was.</p>

      <time minute="0" hour="0">
        <p class="calibre1">'How did you know it was me?' she asked.</p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'My dear Professor,I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.'
        </p>
        <p class="calibre1">'A <i class="calibre5">what</i> ?'</p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'A sherbet lemon.They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of'
        </p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'No, thank you,' said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she
          didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. 'As I say, even if
          You-Know-Who <i class="calibre5">has</i> gone -'
        </p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'My dear Professor, surely a sensible person likeyourself can call him
          by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense – for eleven years I
          have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
          <i class="calibre5">Voldemort</i> .' Professor McGonagall flinched,
          but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to
          notice. 'It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I
          have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's
          name.
        </p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'I know youhaven 't , said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
          exasperated, half admiring. 'But you're different. Everyone knows
          you're the only oneYou- Know- oh, all right,
          <i class="calibre5">Voldemort</i> , was frightened of.'
        </p>
        <p class="calibre1">
          'What they're <i class="calibre5">saying</i> ,' she pressed on, 'is
          that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to
          find the Potters. The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are –
          that they're – <i class="calibre5">dead</i> . '
